Author: Zheng Cheng (chengz@bjaisi.com)

The lr_database inclue e3nn model of asymptotic parameters in the e3nnmodel and sapt data in the saptdata. You can run calc_e_component_camp.py and calc_e_component_hir.py to calculate long-range interactions and compare with the sapt components, the distance between two monomers will also given in the npz file, we only need to consider about the dimers with distance larger than 3.5 angstrom. e3_layer(https://github.com/zhengcheng233/e3_layer.git) and dmff_torch(https://github.com/zhengcheng233/dmff_torch.git) should be first installed.
